# WordPress Release mirror

This is a temporary public repo created to help troubleshoot an issue my team is experiencing with composer and the [WordPress](https://github.com/johnpbloch/wordpress) packages. It is not intended for normal use as it is highly experimental.

It only contains only a small number of releases from the WordPress.org release archive page https://wordpress.org/download/release-archive/. Each has been manually added to the repo and tagged with it's corresponding version number.

As noted previously it's temporary.

Aside: Why doesn't GitHub have GPL2 and BSD3 licenses baked into the license picker? Seems dumb.
